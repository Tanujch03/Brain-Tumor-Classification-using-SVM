# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-SVM


# Abstract<br><br>
Brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. There are 3 types: pituitary tumor, glioma tumor, meningioma tumor.<br>
The proposed approach will greatly aid in the automated identification and classification of Brain Tumor, according to our test results. and by implementing the support vector machine with a classification accuracy of more than 96 percent.

# INTRODUCTION:
•	A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it. Brain tumors can happen in the brain tissue.<br><br>
•	While working with the project we are trying to predict the Brain tumors, while predicting tumors are represented as 0,1,2,3 in the model.<br><br>
                               No tumor - 0<br><br>
                               Pituitary tumor - 1<br><br>
                               Glioma tumor - 2<br><br>
                               Meningioma tumor – 3<br><br>
Pituitary Tumor:<br><br>
Pituitary tumors are unusual growths that develop in the pituitary gland. This gland is an organ about the size of a pea. It's located behind the nose at the base of the brain.<br><br>

Glioma Tumor:<br><br>
Glioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The cells in a glioma look similar to healthy brain cells called glial cells. Glial cells surround nerve cells and help them function.<br>

Meningioma Tumor:<br><br>
A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges — the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.<br>

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br><br>
•	The main goal is to classify the brain in the presence of a brain tumor or a healthy brain.<br><br>
•	The main purpose is to detect the Brain Tumor. Using python and using Support Vector Machine.<br><br>

# Objectives of the Project:<br><br>
•	The brain tumor detection allows localizing a mass of abnormal cells in a slice of Magnetic Resonance (MR) using SVM Classifier. is to classify the brain in the presence of a brain tumor or a healthy brain.<br>

# Organization of the work:<br><br>
1.Installing the dataset(images).<br><br>
2.Load all the required libraries.<br><br>
3.Loading and preparing the data (folder containing the images).<br><br>
4.Analyzing the data.<br><br>
5.Visualising the data.<br><br>
6.Splitting the data.<br><br>
7.Feature Scaling- We are going to use minmax scaling technique to bring all the feature values to less than or equal to 1.<br><br>
8.Training the model.<br><br>
9.Evalutaing the model.<br><br>
10.Predicting the model.<br><br>
11.Testing the model.<br><br>

# Data requirement: <br><br>
Download the Brain tumor Classification dataset. From Kaggle. Dataset Collection: Brain tumor Classification dataset from Kaggle which contains two folders Training and Testing, Training folder which again contains 4 sub-folders No Tumor – 327 images, Pituitary Tumor – 827 images, Glioma Tumor – 826 images, Meningioma Tumor – 247 images. And Testing folder contains 4 sub-folders No Tumor – 104 images, Pituitary Tumor – 98 images, Glioma Tumor – 100 images, Meningioma Tumor – 127 images. total 2656 images.<br><br>

# Project Applicability on real world Applications:<br><br>
Brain tumor detection model using SVM algorithm can be applied in real world. It will help doctors and patients to predict brain tumor by the help of this model with almost of 96% accuracy.<br>
